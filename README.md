**Note:** This is an anonymized version for review. More details and examples will be added if the paper is accepted.

## Project Overview

This project contains various neural network models and circuits for different datasets. The project is organized into the following folders:

- **TNN_moo**: This folder contains example multiobjective optimization for the breast cancer dataset. It also contains a dataset of generated approximate LTGS.
- **generate_ltgs.py**: This folder scripts generates tree adders and compare operations for the CGP approximation tool. It utilizes the `arithsgen` module.
- **Results**: Selected Pareto optimal TNNs for the Breastcancer dataset.
