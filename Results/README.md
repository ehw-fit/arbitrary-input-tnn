# Arbitrary Precision Printed Ternary Neural Networks with Approximate Linear Threshold Gates 
**Note:** This is an anonymized version for review. More details and examples will be added if the paper is accepted.

Each folder contains a Pareto-optimal TNN resulted by our multi-objective optimization. Area and power values refer to the classifier only, i.e., without including interfacing costs.
